# AudioCity
## Rust rework


## Requirements
None right now I don't think.
</br>
MAKE SURE THE "yt-dlp.exe" file is installed in the same directory as the current exe
</br>
Developers will have to move it into the target folden</br>

BTW Thank you [yt-dlp developers](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)! </br>
